TODO (in order of relevance):

- environment/room
- flies can't escape room
- shorten blink
- blink should impact nearby flies
- make pretty

Make pretty TODO:
- Give firefly a proper body (not a sphere)
- lighting effect from firefly
- forest environment, textures
- mist

If time:
- boid movement
- perhaps import some models of trees/plants?
